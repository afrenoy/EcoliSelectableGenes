These data were automatically extracted and parsed from the pdf, using a few bash and python scripts. 
Many mistakes may remain, either introduced by our parsing or present in the original book. Moreover finding a pdf for each reference requires manual work in many cases. You are very welcome to contribute! <br> 
</p>

<p>
Here is what you can do:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix a mistake in one of the tables: just edit the corresponding csv file (<code>table1.csv</code>, <code>table2.csv</code> or <code>references.csv</code>), and the webpage will be updated automatically</li>
  <li>Add a missing pdf: just add it in the <code>pdf/</code> directory, naming it <code>refnumber.pdf</code> (eg <code>84a.pdf</code> or <code>26.pdf</code>), and a link will automatically be generated</li>
  <li>Add a missing link to ecocyc: add a new line to <code>ecocyc.csv</code> linking the name used in our tables with and an ecocyc ID, and a link will automatically be generated</li>
</ul>

<p>
After doing any of these changes, you can just run <code>make</code> to update the main file <code>index.html</code>. If you are satisfied with the outcome, send a patch / a pull request. <br>
Other contributions and suggestions of improvement are also very welcome!
