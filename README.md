Data about mutant selections in *E. coli* and *Salmonella*
===

These data were extracted from chapter 139 of [The Bible](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8575023M), and organized in a parsable format with links to EcoCyc and to full bibliographic information (including pdf file when available).
They consist in two tables, `selections giving rise to mutants` and  `genes for which selections exist`.

See the the data presented as a [webpage](http://ecosalgenes.frenoy.eu) and how you can [contribute](http://ecosalgenes.frenoy.eu/index.html#contribute-anchor) and modify this webpage.

In addition comments and suggestions are also welcome.
