===

These data were extracted from chapter 139 of [The Bible](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8575023M), and organized in a parsable format with links to EcoCyc and to full bibliographic information (including pdf file when available).
They consist in two tables, [selections giving rise to mutants](http://ecosalgenes.frenoy.eu/index.html#table1-selections-giving-rise-to-mutants) and  [genes for which selections exist](http://ecosalgenes.frenoy.eu/index.html#table2-genes-for-which-selections-exist).

See the the data presented as a [webpage](http://ecosalgenes.frenoy.eu) and how you can [contribute](http://ecosalgenes.frenoy.eu/index.html#how-to-contribute) and modify this webpage.
