<p>
<a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8575023M"><em>Escherichia coli and Salmonella</em></a> is the bible of microbiology. It contains data daily used by many researchers. The chapter 139 (<em>Mutant Selections Linking Physiology, Inhibitors, and Genotypes</em>), by Robert A. LaRossa, contains two famous tables listing all genes for which a positive or negative selection has been reported in the litterature. While a pdf is available from <a href="http://www.asmscience.org/files/Chapter_139_Mutant_Selections_Linking_Physiology.pdf">ASM</a>, its format makes it hard to use. Moreover it contains small mistakes that could easily be corrected (eg typos in the reference table). Eventually academics may want to collectively keep updating this table with more recent litterature.
</p>
<p>
For these reasons, I extracted these two tables from the pdf and created this easily parsable and updatable webpage, with links between gene names and EcoCyc, and between reference number and full bibliographic information (including a pdf when available).

<p>
The raw data can also be downloaded as csv files:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selections giving rise to mutants: <a href="#table1-anchor">view online</a> or <a href="table1.csv">download raw data</a></li>
  <li>Genes for which selections exist: <a href="#table2-anchor">view online</a> or <a href="table2.csv">download raw data</a></li>
  <li>Bibliographic references: <a href="#references-anchor">view online</a> or <a href="references.csv">downlad raw data</a></li>
</ul>
