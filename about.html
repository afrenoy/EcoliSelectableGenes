<p>
<em>Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology</em> is the bible of microbiology. It contains data daily used by many researcher. The chapter 139 (<em>Mutant Selections Linking Physiology, Inhibitors, and Genotypes</em>), by Robert A. LaRossa, contains two famous tables listing all genes for which a positive or negative selection is known in the litterature. While a pdf is available from <a href="http://www.asmscience.org/files/Chapter_139_Mutant_Selections_Linking_Physiology.pdf">ASM</a>, its format makes it hard to use. Moreover it contains small mistakes that could easily be corrected (eg typos in the reference table). Finally academics may want to collectively keep updating this table with more recent litterature.<br>
For these reasons we provide below these two tables in an easily searchable and parseable format, with links between gene names and ecocyc, and between reference number and full bibliographic information (including a pdf when available). See below <a href="#contribute">how you can contribute</a>.<br>
